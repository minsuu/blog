I've heard many times that VS code is the best, but have not tried one yet
since I felt comfortable with my current environment.
However, when I began to use it, it changed a lot of things. :smiley:

## Before

I really did like the Vim style editing.
I almost banned using arrow keys, `Ctrl+F` should be used for navigation,
and `Ctrl+V` should be mapped to visual blocks.

So I used Vim in a remote server for coding C++/Python.
However, I've also had to spend some time using markdown editor
called [Typora][typora] to write some documents.
It worked quite well for me, since I could get live view of latex equations.
I also used Sublime Text for local files because it's hard to use terminal on
Windows..

So, I used 3 applications, each of which had its own rules.
There was no problem at all, but certainly not an ideal thing.
Also, there were some points that Vim is missing: IDE-level smart linting.

## After

I could replace all the programs above into one VS code environment.
It supported linting quite well, with Pylint.
Vim plugin in VS Code worked way better than in Sublime Text.
I was able to get preview of my markdown by another plugin.
I was also able to mimic the behavior of Typora for pasting images.

The reason I haven't tried the recent text editors like Atom was
simply its heaviness. However, I feel VS code is much lighter than Atom.
It's true there are delays sometimes, it's bearable for me.
