I've took [Kakao blind test][kakao] last week.
It was an online coding test that took about 5hrs long.
I was shocked that I've missed 2 problems out of 7!

The first of the two was about reconstructing a tree given points
with the $(x,y)$ coordinate, from specific rules like
(a) parent has bigger $y$ coordinate than its children, and 
(b) the left child has smaller $x$ coodrdinate than its parent.
I implemented it with recursion, then faced RTE(runtime error).
I once thought about the stack depth, however, denied that possiblity
since the maximum depth of a tree was $1000$. It was a sheer misunderstanding.

Only after the test I found [that][slimit] Python has a very limited recursion depth($<998$).
It was due to my first time using python in a test, and also this gave me a precious lesson using Python: *never think of using recursion*.
I also once read about [function call overhead][func] in Python.
I sought after some optimizations for function calls in Python, but hardly could find any.
